# ðŸ§® Calculator Project  
Part of the Foundations course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Overview
A fully functional on-screen calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs standard math operations and emphasizes understanding UI logic and state management without relying on `eval()` or unsafe methods. This project was completed as the final assignment for the Foundations course and meets all core requirements.

## Goals
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling in vanilla JS
- Reinforce logic and flow control with ifs, functions, and conditionals
- Create a clean, responsive UI
- Learn how to manage state in a small, real-world application

## Features
- Clickable buttons for numbers, operators, clear, and equals
- Displays current input and results with proper formatting
- Supports chained operations (e.g. `5 + 5 x 2`)
- Prevents divide-by-zero and invalid input cases
- Rounded decimal output to prevent overflow
- Visual feedback for active operator
- Resets correctly using the Clear and Delete buttons
- Fully accessible via keyboard input (top row and numpad)

## Bonus Extras
âœ… Decimal input with one-dot restriction  
âœ… Backspace/delete button  
âœ… Keyboard support (`0â€“9`, `+ - * /`, `Enter`, `=`, `Backspace`, `Escape`)

This was built while learning, experimenting, and breaking things â€” and figuring out how real calculator logic works under the hood. A solid end to the Foundations course and the start of building more interactive apps.
