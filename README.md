# ðŸ§® Calculator Project  
Part of the Foundations course from The Odin Project

## Overview
This is a basic on-screen calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles standard math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and lays the groundwork for learning how to handle UI logic and state without relying on `eval()` or unsafe methods.

## Goals
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling in vanilla JS
- Reinforce logic and flow control with ifs, functions, and conditionals
- Create a clean, responsive UI
- Learn how to manage state in a small app

## Features
- Clickable buttons for numbers, operators, clear, and equals
- Displays current inputs and results
- Handles chained operations properly
- Prevents divide-by-zero and other weird edge cases
- Error messages and rounding for long decimals

## Bonus Extras (to be complete later)
- Decimal input (and disables extra decimals)
- Backspace/delete button
- Keyboard support

Built while learning, experimenting, and understanding how calculator logic actually works under the hood.
